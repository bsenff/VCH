# Voidtime Chronoverse Hypothesis (VCH)

The **Voidtime Chronoverse Hypothesis (VCH)** is an open, modular framework exploring the possibility that **cosmic time flows at different rates depending on large-scale structure**‚Äîparticularly in underdense regions (voids). 

**Statistical Confirmations (July 2025):**
- **VCH-001**: Void supernovae appear ~3.2% more distant (p = 0.0379) ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**
- **VCH-002**: Void supernovae show ~26% lower redshifts (p = 0.0019) ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**

The framework now includes **Integrated Temporal Distortion (ITD)** - cumulative time effects along photon paths - explaining multiple cosmological anomalies:

- Early massive galaxy formation (z > 13) through accelerated void evolution + ITD
- Hubble tension via environmental bias in distance measurements  
- CMB entropy variations correlated with large-scale structure
- Systematic patterns in cosmological observables from path-integrated time effects

VCH combines confirmed observational effects with theoretical extensions spanning astrobiology, gravitational mapping, and alternative cosmological interpretations.
