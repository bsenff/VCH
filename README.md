# Voidtime Chronoverse Hypothesis (VCH)

The **Voidtime Chronoverse Hypothesis (VCH)** is an open, modular framework exploring the possibility that **cosmic time flows at different rates depending on large-scale structure**‚Äîparticularly in underdense regions (voids). This framework aims to explain multiple unresolved cosmological anomalies such as:

- The early appearance of massive galaxies (z > 13)
- The Hubble tension (discrepant expansion rates)
- Entropy irregularities in the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
- Non-random patterns in large-scale structure or redshift

VCH proposes that differential time flow, simulation artifacts, and redshift decomposition may be essential to understanding these phenomena.
