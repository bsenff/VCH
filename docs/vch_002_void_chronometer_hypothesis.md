# VCH-002: Void Chronometer Hypothesis

## 🧠 Hypothesis
Galaxies within large-scale cosmic voids exhibit systematically older stellar population ages than galaxies in denser regions at the same redshift, due to faster local time progression caused by reduced gravitational potential.

---

## 🔍 Motivation
This hypothesis addresses the possibility that **gravitational time dilation across large-scale structures** may produce measurable differences in stellar evolution when comparing galaxies at equivalent cosmological distances.

It builds on:
- The concept of differential clock rates in general relativity
- The observed consistency of galaxy redshifts regardless of local density
- The theoretical possibility of timescape cosmology and inhomogeneous expansion

---

## 🧪 Observables
- Mean stellar population ages (from FSPS models)
- Spectral energy distribution and metallicity
- Void and wall galaxy classifications
- Same-redshift galaxy population comparisons

---

## 🔬 Methodology
1. Identify galaxy samples at matched redshifts (e.g., z = 0.1 to 0.3)
2. Classify each galaxy's environment (void, filament, cluster)
3. Use stellar synthesis tools (e.g., FSPS, Prospector) to infer mean stellar ages
4. Compute statistical age differentials between void and cluster samples

Datasets:
- Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
- Euclid or DESI galaxy structure catalogs
- LSST (for future expansion)

---

## 📈 Expected Results (If True)
- Galaxies in voids show >5% greater inferred ages than galaxies in denser regions at the same z
- Statistical confidence >3σ in age differential across bins
- Minimal correlation with mass or metallicity (ruling out other drivers)

---

## ❌ Falsifiability Criteria
- No statistically significant age difference between void and wall galaxies
- Age differences explained entirely by metallicity, mass, or SFH variation
- Observed patterns match ΛCDM predictions without invoking time differential

---

## 🔗 Data & Tools
- SDSS DR17, DESI, Euclid
- FSPS, Prospector, Python/AstroPy
- Void catalogs: Cosmicflows-3, VIDE

---

## 📝 Notes
- Requires care in accounting for mass, morphology, and dust attenuation
- Statistical signal may be small and require large sample sizes
- This module provides potential support for VCH central time flow differential concept established in VCH-001
