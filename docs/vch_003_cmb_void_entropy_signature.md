# VCH-003: CMB Void Entropy Signature

## 🧠 Hypothesis
Large-scale cosmic voids display lower-than-expected entropy and temperature variation in the CMB, potentially due to long-term heat extraction, reduced photon scattering, or artifacts from simulated entropy optimization.

---

## 🔍 Motivation
This hypothesis addresses:
- The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect being weaker or inconsistent over certain voids
- Observed cold spots (e.g., the Eridanus supervoid) aligned with voids without sufficient structure to explain them
- The possibility that voids serve as **entropy sinks**, either naturally or through manipulation by advanced processes (e.g., computation, simulation pruning)

---

## 🧪 Observables
- CMB temperature anomalies aligned with known cosmic voids
- Spatial entropy measurements from CMB data (Shannon, Lempel-Ziv, wavelet entropy)
- Spectral deviations or cold spot statistics

---

## 🔬 Methodology
1. Overlay CMB maps (Planck, WMAP) with known void locations (e.g., VIDE, Cosmicflows)
2. Measure temperature deviation and statistical entropy within voids vs. control regions
3. Compare with ISW predictions under ΛCDM
4. Explore residuals using wavelet transforms or machine learning anomaly detection

Datasets:
- Planck CMB full-sky map (temperature + polarization)
- Cosmic void catalogs (VIDE, SDSS-based)

---

## 📈 Expected Results (If True)
- Persistent temperature suppression over void centers beyond ISW predictions
- Detectable entropy suppression (statistically significant difference)
- Cold spots not fully explainable by line-of-sight underdensity alone

---

## ❌ Falsifiability Criteria
- Entropy and temperature variations within expected ΛCDM ISW bounds
- No systematic void alignment with CMB anomalies
- CMB noise and foregrounds fully explain cold spot profiles

---

## 🔗 Data & Tools
- Planck Legacy Archive, WMAP
- VIDE / SDSS void catalogs
- Entropy calculators (Python, MATLAB, R)
- PyCMB, healpy, SciPy

---

## 📝 Notes
- Void size threshold may affect signal detectability
- Hypothesis overlaps with VCH-005 (sky structure analysis)
- If confirmed, may also support simulation artifact or energy optimization theory
