# VCH-005: Sky Pattern Artifact Analysis

## 🧠 Hypothesis
Large-scale sky maps, including the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy distribution surveys, contain statistically unlikely **symmetries, alignments, or low-multipole anomalies** inconsistent with stochastic structure formation—potentially indicating simulation-level rendering artifacts or universal compression.

---

## 🔍 Motivation
This hypothesis addresses:
- The persistent "Axis of Evil" alignment in CMB low-l multipoles
- Anomalies in quadrupole and octopole directionality
- Apparent alignment of structure with solar ecliptic coordinates
- Possible non-Gaussian structure or mirrored regions in large-scale structure

These features may reflect:
- Compression-optimized topology (simulation artifact)
- Computation-reduction bias (zones of reduced entropy or resolution)

---

## 🧪 Observables
- CMB multipole statistics (l ≤ 10)
- Harmonic decomposition of galaxy density fields
- Sky quadrant symmetry analyses
- Residual non-Gaussianity after foreground subtraction

---

## 🔬 Methodology
1. Use Planck and WMAP CMB data to extract low-l multipoles
2. Analyze alignment with solar, galactic, and cosmological reference frames
3. Perform statistical comparison with synthetic ΛCDM skies (10,000+ samples)
4. Use ML or anomaly detection tools to classify non-random patterns
5. Optionally extend to galaxy clustering datasets (e.g., 2dF, SDSS, LSST)

---

## 📈 Expected Results (If True)
- Multipole alignments persist at >3σ significance
- Quadrant or hemispheric structure non-random under simulation tests
- AI anomaly classifiers flag regions inconsistent with stochastic origin

---

## ❌ Falsifiability Criteria
- Synthetic skies show same anomaly frequency as real data
- All observed alignments attributable to foregrounds or systematics
- Residuals match expectations from known cosmological models

---

## 🔗 Data & Tools
- Planck, WMAP CMB maps
- SDSS, 2dFGRS, LSST galaxy surveys
- PyCMB, healpy, NumPy, SciPy
- Custom GAN or PCA-based anomaly classifiers

---

## 📝 Notes
- May overlap with VCH-004 (CMB entropy in voids)
- A positive result could support both simulation hypothesis and temporal granularity assumptions
- Requires strict statistical handling to avoid confirmation bias
