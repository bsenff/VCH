# Voidtime Chronoverse Hypothesis (VCH) ‚Äî Module Index

This is a living index of all current VCH modules. Each module is a testable, self-contained hypothesis exploring anomalies or alternative mechanisms in cosmology, often focused on time differentials, structure-induced variation, or simulated artifact detection.

## üì¶ Module List

### **VCH-001: Redshift Decomposition Model**
**Summary**: Redshift contains additional components beyond expansion‚Äîgravitational, tired light, or observational processing effects.
- Status: Drafted
- Theme: Redshift reinterpretation, metric limitations, Hubble tension

### **VCH-002: Void Chronometer Hypothesis**
**Summary**: Galaxies in voids age faster due to time dilation, appearing older than galaxies in dense regions at the same redshift.
- Status: Drafted
- Theme: Time flow, stellar aging

### **VCH-003: High-z Galaxy Chronology Conflict**
**Summary**: Early massive galaxies (z > 13) are explained by differential time progression in voids rather than exotic structure formation.
- Status: Drafted
- Theme: JWST anomalies, early evolution, void clocks

### **VCH-004: CMB Void Entropy Signature**
**Summary**: CMB observed through voids exhibits entropy suppression and temperature dips inconsistent with standard ISW predictions.
- Status: Drafted
- Theme: CMB anomalies, entropy, void interactions

### **VCH-005: Sky Pattern Artifact Analysis**
**Summary**: Large-scale anomalies in the CMB and LSS maps may reflect simulation-level rendering constraints or non-random compression patterns.
- Status: Drafted
- Theme: Simulation theory, CMB multipoles, AI detection
