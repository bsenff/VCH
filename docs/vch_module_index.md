# VCH Module Index (Updated)

## üî≠ Core Hypothesis
Time flows at different rates across large-scale structures of the universe, particularly between voids and dense regions. These time differentials manifest observationally as redshift anomalies, distance modulus distortions, entropy variations, and topological artifacts in sky maps.

Additionally, light emitted from distant sources may accumulate time distortions as it traverses the structured universe. This **Integrated Temporal Distortion (ITD)** may cause systematic redshift inflation or misinterpretation of age/distance of high-z objects.

## üìö Module List

### **VCH-001**: Supernova Distance Discrepancies
- **Focus**: Apparent magnitude differences in SN Ia across environments
- **Outcome**: Void supernovae appear ~3.2% farther (p = 0.0379)
- **Implication**: Time dilation or distance misestimation tied to cosmic structure

### **VCH-002**: Environment-Dependent Redshift
- **Focus**: Redshift shift in SN Ia by void/wall/cluster category
- **Outcome**: Void SN show 26% lower redshift at fixed distance (p = 0.0019)
- **Implication**: Evidence of redshift components beyond expansion (time skew)

### **VCH-003**: Cosmic Microwave Background Entropy Variance
- **Focus**: Differences in CMB entropy across sky regions (esp. void-correlated)
- **Goal**: Test for anisotropic cooling or temporal smoothing linked to voids

### **VCH-004**: Early Galaxy Formation Tension (z > 10)
- **Focus**: Implausibly mature galaxies (e.g. at z ~ 13‚Äì14)
- **Goal**: Determine if timeflow variance + Integrated Temporal Distortion (ITD) can explain early maturity
- **Note**: Combines local rapid evolution (fast clocks in early voids) and compounded propagation effects across cosmic structures

### **VCH-005**: Sky Pattern Artifact Analysis
- **Focus**: Symmetry, axis alignments (e.g., Axis of Evil), and multipole anomalies
- **Goal**: Identify evidence of simulation constraints or compression artifacts

### **VCH-003-A**: CMB as Foreground Reflection (Non-Big Bang)
- **Parent**: VCH-003 (CMB Entropy Variance)
- **Focus**: Test hypothesis that CMB may result from faint early-galaxy backlighting
- **Goal**: Explore spectral fit against deep-galaxy emission rather than relic radiation
