# VCH-001: Redshift Decomposition Model

## 🧠 Hypothesis
Cosmological redshift contains components beyond metric expansion—specifically, contributions from gravitational time differentials and potential light degradation effects ("tired light"). These may explain discrepancies in distance estimates and contribute to the Hubble tension.

---

## 🔍 Motivation
This hypothesis is motivated by:
- The persistent **Hubble tension** between early-universe (CMB) and late-universe (supernova) expansion rate measurements
- The observation that redshift appears universal, yet may be affected by **local structure**, **clocks**, and **line-of-sight gravitational potential**
- Historical proposals of tired light, reframed here as a **supplemental component**, not a replacement for expansion

---

## 🧪 Observables
- Redshift-distance relationships from Type Ia supernovae
- Redshift deviations in void vs. cluster environments
- Galaxy surface brightness as a proxy for redshift energy decay

---

## 🔬 Methodology
1. Compare SN Ia magnitude residuals in underdense vs. overdense environments
2. Use void/environment catalogs to isolate samples
3. Assess whether residuals correlate with structure or density, beyond standard cosmological models
4. Model possible gravitational or optical attenuation contributions to observed redshift

Datasets:
- Pantheon+, SCP Union2.1 SN catalogs
- DES and SDSS environment classification
- Cosmological model calculators (CAMB, CLASS)

---

## 📈 Expected Results (If True)
- Redshift-distance residuals vary systematically with environment
- Environmental correction improves SN-based H₀ estimate alignment with Planck
- Simulation shows gravitational potential causes measurable Δz

---

## ❌ Falsifiability Criteria
- Residuals in SN distance modulus uncorrelated with environment
- No evidence of structure-based redshift decomposition
- Metric expansion alone explains all observed variation

---

## 🔗 Data & Tools
- Pantheon+ SN dataset
- VIDE void catalog
- CAMB / CLASS for ΛCDM predictions
- Python, AstroPy, NumPy

---

## 📝 Notes
- Must isolate from gravitational lensing and peculiar velocities
- Redshift decomposition is not proposed as an alternative to expansion, but as a **complementary component**
- Can inform or constrain timescape cosmology and VCH-002
