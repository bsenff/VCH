# VCH-001: Redshift Decomposition Model

## üß† Hypothesis
Cosmological redshift can be decomposed into multiple physical components beyond metric expansion: gravitational time differentials arising from large-scale structure inhomogeneities (as in timescape cosmology), integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects, and potentially systematic environmental biases in distance calibration. This multi-component framework may help resolve the Hubble tension by accounting for previously neglected gravitational and environmental contributions to observed redshift-distance relationships.

---

## üîç Motivation
This hypothesis addresses the **5-6œÉ Hubble tension** between early-universe (Planck: H‚ÇÄ = 67.4 ¬± 0.5 km/s/Mpc) and late-universe (SH0ES: H‚ÇÄ = 73.04 ¬± 1.04 km/s/Mpc) measurements. Recent work has largely ruled out systematic errors and environmental effects as primary causes, suggesting new physics may be required.

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- **Wiltshire's Timescape Cosmology (2024)**: Strong Bayesian evidence favoring timescape over ŒõCDM using Pantheon+ data, demonstrating ~35% clock rate differences between voids and dense regions
- **Buchert's Averaging Formalism**: Mathematical framework showing how local inhomogeneities create backreaction effects in cosmological evolution
- **Bondi's Redshift Decomposition (1947)**: Established that redshift contains separable kinematic and gravitational components

**Key Insight:** Rather than requiring new fundamental physics, the tension may arise from incomplete treatment of known gravitational effects in FLRW averaging, following established general relativity principles.

## üß™ Observables
**Primary Observables:**
- Type Ia supernova distance modulus residuals vs. large-scale environment
- H‚ÇÄ estimates from different environmental contexts (void vs. cluster lines-of-sight)
- Integrated Sachs-Wolfe signatures in CMB-galaxy cross-correlations

**Environmental Tracers:**
- Void probability functions from galaxy surveys (SDSS, DESI)
- Large-scale structure density fields and gravitational potential maps
- Peculiar velocity flows and their correlation with distance residuals

**Control Tests:**
- Comparison with time dilation observations (ruling out pure tired light)
- Surface brightness evolution (Tolman test consistency)
- CMB blackbody spectrum preservation

## üî¨ Methodology
**Phase 1: Environmental Analysis**
1. Correlate Pantheon+ SN residuals with large-scale environment using VIDE void catalogs
2. Perform statistical analysis controlling for host galaxy mass, morphology, and dust
3. Test for systematic H‚ÇÄ variation as function of environmental density

**Phase 2: Gravitational Modeling**
4. Apply Buchert averaging formalism to quantify expected backreaction effects
5. Model gravitational redshift contributions using Sachs-Wolfe integral along photon paths
6. Compare predictions with observed residual patterns

**Phase 3: Validation**
7. Cross-validate with time dilation data (preserving expansion signature)
8. Ensure consistency with CMB observations and surface brightness evolution
9. Test predictions against independent datasets (DESI, Euclid upcoming)

**Key Datasets:**
- **Pantheon+ (2022)**: 1,701 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae
- **VIDE**: Cosmic void catalogs from SDSS DR12
- **Planck PR4**: CMB temperature and polarization maps
- **6dFGS + SDSS peculiar velocity surveys**
- **Cosmological N-body simulations**: Millennium, IllustrisTNG for theoretical modeling

---

## üìà Expected Results (If True)
**Quantitative Predictions:**
- Environmental H‚ÇÄ variation: 2-4 km/s/Mpc difference between void and cluster lines-of-sight
- SN distance modulus residuals correlate with environmental density at >3œÉ significance
- Reduced œá¬≤ in cosmological fits when environmental corrections applied

**Specific Signatures:**
- **Void Supernovae**: Appear ~5-10% more distant than ŒõCDM prediction (consistent with faster local time)
- **Cluster Supernovae**: Appear ~2-5% closer than prediction (slower local time)
- **H‚ÇÄ Convergence**: Environmental averaging reduces tension from 5-6œÉ to <3œÉ

**Model Validation:**
- Backreaction effects of magnitude ~10‚Åª‚Åµ at z~0.1, scaling approximately as (1+z)
- Gravitational redshift contributions detectable in cross-correlation analyses
- Preserved time dilation signatures (distinguishing from pure tired light)

## ‚ùå Falsifiability Criteria
**Null Results (Falsifying Evidence):**
- SN distance residuals show no correlation with environmental density (p > 0.1)
- H‚ÇÄ estimates independent of large-scale structure context within measurement uncertainties
- Environmental corrections fail to reduce Hubble tension below 4œÉ

**Alternative Explanations:**
- Systematic errors in environmental classification fully explain correlations
- Host galaxy properties (mass, metallicity, SFR) account for all observed residual patterns
- Pure metric expansion + known systematics explain all variation within 2œÉ

**Critical Tests:**
- **Time Dilation Consistency**: Any deviation from (1+z) time dilation falsifies the hypothesis
- **CMB Blackbody**: Any distortion of CMB spectrum rules out non-gravitational redshift mechanisms
- **Surface Brightness**: Deviation from (1+z)‚Åª‚Å¥ evolution falsifies static universe components
