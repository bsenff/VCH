# Contributing to the Voidtime Chronoverse Hypothesis (VCH)

Welcome! This project is open to contributors from all backgrounds‚Äîwhether you're a professional physicist, amateur cosmologist, coder, writer, or simply curious.

## üìö Project Scope

The **Voidtime Chronoverse Hypothesis (VCH)** explores the possibility that time flows at different rates across cosmic structures (especially voids), with implications for:

- Redshift reinterpretation
- The Hubble tension
- Early galaxy formation
- Simulation artifacts
- CMB anomalies

All contributions should support one of the **modular hypotheses** and aim for **observational relevance or falsifiability**.

---

## üß© Ways to Contribute

- Propose a new VCH module (using the `VCH_Template.md` format)
- Add analysis or observations to an existing module
- Submit datasets, code, or notebook tools
- Offer critique, falsification tests, or alternate explanations
- Help with documentation, diagrams, or translations
